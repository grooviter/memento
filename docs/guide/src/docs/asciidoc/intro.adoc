Memento is a Groovy library which can be used to implement an Event Sourcing solution. Memento tries to provide a high

- **Event**: Something that expresses a change in a specific aggregate.
- **EventStore**: Stores and retrieves all aggregates events, and it's capable of restore the state of an aggregate
