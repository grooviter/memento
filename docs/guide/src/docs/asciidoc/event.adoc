== Event

An event in Memento is a class extending `memento.Event` and it will be always be applied
to a specific type of Aggregate:

.Declaring Event
```groovy
import memento.Event

class MyEvent extends Event<AggregateType> {
  // event properties here
}
```

The event then can be applied to the aggregate it belongs to. The events will be integrated in the aggregate
by using the `Aggregate#apply(event)` method. Although this method can be used directly, normally we can create
domain related methods:

.Declaring Event
```groovy
import memento.Event
import groovy.transform.InheritConstructors

class NameAdded extends Event<User> {
    String name
}

class AddressAdded extends Event<User> {
    String address
}

@InheritConstructors
class User extends Aggregate {
    String name, address

    static User create(String name) {
        return new User(UUID.randomUUID).apply(new NameAdded(name)
    }

    User mainAddress(String address) {
        return this.apply(new AddressAdded(address))
    }

    @Override
    void configure() {
        bind(NameAdded, AddressAdded)
    }
}
```

And then we can use a fluid method chaining if we want to:

.fluid method chaining
```groovy
User aggregate = User
    .create("John")
    .mainAddress("42 First Avenue")
```

Once we have our aggregate populated we may need to persist all the events in some event store. This is explained in the
next section.
