== Theory

[quote, , 'Event Sourcing definition at https://www.eventstore.com/blog/what-is-event-sourcing[eventstore.com]']
Event Sourcing is an alternative way to persist data. In contrast with state-oriented persistence that only keeps
the latest version of the entity state, Event Sourcing stores each state mutation as a separate record called an event.

**Every change is registered in an event log** so that we can keep an audit trail. For instance imagine we'd like to
keep track of our bank account deposits and withdrawals:

We're using our account id (AID), a version number to denote the order of events happening, the type of event, the value
deposited or withdraw and finally when the event happened. Storing data this way enables among other things:

- **HISTORICAL REVIEW**: we can **re-create the state of our account at any given point in time**
- **HETEROGENEOUS USES OF THE DATA**: we can create **different views of the data** depending on our requirements

=== Historical Review

Marting Fowler https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html[highlights historical review features]
of event sourcing:

- **COMPLETE REBUILD**: rebuild the application state from the event log
- **TEMPORAL QUERY**: determine the application state in a given moment in time
- **EVENT REPLAY**: the possibility to compute consequences of past events and maybe replay those events differently

Following our bank account example, I may want to know why my balance is at a given state, and the bank must be able
to show every event until the current state so that there's no doubt about the current balance.
If the bank stored only the last state that information would be lost forever. However because we've stored every
event we can answer that question:

=== Heterogeneous Uses

Another use case is **when the data the system is producing is being consumed in different ways by different systems**.

For example, in an e-commerce application, different departments could be interested in different views of the data,
accounting might be interested in sales whereas marketing could be interested in user fidelity. In such systems there
are always more reads than writes.

An architectural pattern applied to this use case is **CQRS** (**C**ommand/**Q**uery **R**esponsibility **S**egregation).
This pattern uses the idea of using a different model for create information than the model used for reading information.

An **event log** could be used in this context to be **the single source of truth** of the system.
From there any reading system could read from the event store and then create their own views to serve to their clients.
